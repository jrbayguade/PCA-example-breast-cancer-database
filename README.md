üß™ PCA Analysis of Breast Cancer Dataset
This repository contains a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) exercise using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from Scikit-learn.

üß™ Factor Analysis
After walking trhough the PCA, I'll then apply the Factor Reduction algorithm to figure out what approach provides more insights.

üîç Overview
The goal of this project is to explore and visualize high-dimensional medical data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) . This technique helps in:
- Reducing dimensionality.
- Visualizing class separation (malignant vs. benign tumors).
- Understanding feature contributions through loadings.
- Evaluating how much variance is captured by each principal component.

If you are intested in dimensionality reduction techniques, I also have this other [PCA example](https://github.com/jrbayguade/DataTreatment_DimensionalityReduction_PCA/blob/PCA_Class/T7_1_PCA_Principal_Component_Analysis.ipynb) or this [Factor Reduction](https://github.com/jrbayguade/jrbayguade-Data_treatment_Dimensionality_Reduction_Factorial_Analaysis/blob/main/T7_Factorial_Analysis.ipynb) example, both with plenty of documentation.
